# Getting Started with R and RStudio

In this chapter we explain what **R** and **RStudio** are, how they relate to each other, and how to set them up for everyday work.

## R vs RStudio: what is the difference?

- **R** is the engine. It is the language and computation engine that reads your code and does the calculations.
- **RStudio** is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** that makes R easier and nicer to use. It provides menus, panes, syntax highlighting, and many shortcuts.

You can run R without RStudio (for example, in a plain terminal), but RStudio makes your life much easier, especially when you are starting out.

A rough analogy:

- R is like a powerful microscope.
- RStudio is like the comfortable lab bench, chair, and light that make using the microscope pleasant and efficient.

## Installing R

1. Go to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website.
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the default options.

After installation, you will have an application called **R** (sometimes "R x.y.z" where x.y.z is the version number).

## Installing RStudio

1. Go to the RStudio (Posit) website and download **RStudio Desktop** (the free version is fine).
2. Install it as you would any other application.
3. When you open RStudio, it automatically finds your R installation.

## The RStudio layout

When you open RStudio, you usually see four main panes:

1. **Source pane** (top-left): where you write and edit scripts (`.R` files) and notebooks (`.Rmd` files).
2. **Console pane** (bottom-left): where R actually runs your code and shows results.
3. **Environment / History pane** (top-right): shows the objects currently in memory and a history of commands.
4. **Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer pane** (bottom-right): shows files, plots, installed packages, help pages, etc.

You can resize these panes or change their layout in the RStudio options, but the default layout works well for most people.

## The R console

The **console** is where R reads and runs your commands. The prompt usually looks like this:

```r
>
```

(Do not type the `>` yourself; R prints it to indicate it is ready for input.)

You can type simple commands into the console and press Enter, for example:

```r
1 + 1
```

R will respond with:

```r
[1] 2
```

The `[1]` just means "this is the first element of the result". For now, you can ignore it.

The console is useful for quick experiments, but for real work we strongly recommend using **scripts**.

## Scripts and reproducible analysis

An **R script** is a plain text file with extension `.R` that contains sequences of R commands.

Advantages of using scripts:

- You can save your work, run it again later, or share it with collaborators.
- You can run the entire analysis from top to bottom with a single command.
- It is easier to debug and to keep track of changes.

To create a new script in RStudio:

1. Click **File → New File → R Script**.
2. A new tab opens in the Source pane.
3. Type some R code, for example:

```r
x <- 1:10
mean(x)
```

4. To run a line, place the cursor on that line and press **Cmd+Enter** (macOS) or **Ctrl+Enter** (Windows/Linux). The code runs in the console and the result appears below.

We will use scripts extensively in later chapters.

## Projects in RStudio

RStudio **projects** help you organise your files, data, and scripts for each analysis or paper.

When you create a project, RStudio:

- Sets the working directory to the project folder.
- Remembers your open files and settings.
- Helps keep separate analyses from interfering with each other.

To create a project for this book:

1. In RStudio, click **File → New Project…**.
2. Choose **Existing Directory**.
3. Browse to the folder `A-Simple-R-Cookbook-for-Biomedical-Researchers`.
4. Click **Create Project**.

Now, whenever you open the `.Rproj` file in that folder, RStudio will load the project with the book.

## Installing and loading packages

R has a small set of functions built in, but most of the power comes from **packages**. A package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation.

To install a package from CRAN, use `install.packages()` (you only need to do this once per computer):

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

To use the package in a session, you need to **load** it with `library()` every time you start R:

```r
library(tidyverse)
```

If R says that a package is not installed, double-check the spelling and your internet connection.

## Summary

In this chapter you learned:

- The difference between **R** (the language/engine) and **RStudio** (the user interface).
- How to install both.
- How to use the console, scripts, and projects.
- How to install and load packages.

In the next chapters we will explore what kinds of data R works with and how these are represented in memory.
