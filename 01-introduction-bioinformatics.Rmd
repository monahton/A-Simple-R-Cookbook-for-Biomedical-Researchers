# Introduction: R for Bioinformatics and Biomedical Data Analysis

R is a free, open-source language designed for **data analysis and statistics**. It has become a standard tool in many areas of science, including bioinformatics, genomics, and clinical research.

In this chapter we will:

- Explain what R is and why it is useful for biomedical researchers.
- Discuss how R is used in bioinformatics.
- Clarify the goals and style of this book.

## What is R?

R is both:

1. A **programming language**, and
2. An **environment for data analysis**.

You can think of R as a very smart calculator that understands tables of data, can draw figures, and can run statistical tests. Unlike spreadsheet software, R keeps a record of exactly what you did in code, which makes your work **reproducible** and **transparent**.

### Why use R instead of only spreadsheets or GUI tools?

Many biomedical researchers start with tools like Excel, GraphPad Prism, or instrument vendor software. These tools are useful, but they have limitations:

- Repeating the same analysis for many datasets becomes tedious.
- Manual steps are easy to forget or mis-click, which can lead to subtle errors.
- Collaboration is harder because others cannot easily see every step you took.

R addresses these issues because:

- Your analysis is written as **code**, so it can be saved, shared, and re-run.
- You can apply the same code to new data with minimal changes.
- You have access to thousands of **packages** contributed by other scientists.

## R in bioinformatics and biomedical research

R is widely used in:

- **Transcriptomics** (microarrays, RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq)
- **Genomics and variant analysis**
- **Proteomics and metabolomics**
- **Flow cytometry and imaging data analysis**
- **Clinical data analysis and epidemiology**

The Bioconductor project (a large collection of R packages for bioinformatics) has made R particularly strong for high-throughput data.

However, in this book we do **not** assume you are doing advanced omics analysis from day one. Instead, we focus on the **core skills** that apply to almost any biomedical dataset:

- Reading data into R
- Cleaning and transforming variables
- Combining multiple tables
- Summarising and visualising results

Once you are comfortable with those foundations, you will be able to pick up more specialised tools (for RNA-seq, proteomics, etc.) much more easily.

## Less about programming, more about data analysis

There are many excellent books that teach R as a general programming language or focus heavily on computer science concepts. This book takes a different approach.

Our priorities are:

- **Clarity**: Use simple language and concrete examples from biomedical research.
- **Practicality**: Show tasks you actually need in day-to-day data analysis.
- **Reproducibility**: Encourage good habits from the start.

We will explain enough programming concepts so that you understand what your code is doing, but we will not dive deep into things like object-oriented programming, advanced software design patterns, or building complex applications.

If you can:

- Load your data into R
- Clean and reshape it
- Join different tables
- Make clear plots
- Run basic analyses and export the results

…then this book has achieved its goal.

## How to use this book

You can read the chapters in order, or jump directly to topics you need. However, we recommend that beginners at least skim the early chapters about:

- R and RStudio
- Data types and data structures

Later chapters on data wrangling and visualisation build on those concepts.

Throughout the book we will:

- Use a consistent coding style.
- Show example code **and** the corresponding output.
- Use a simple, simulated biomedical dataset packaged in **biomedrdata**.

If something is confusing, do not worry—this is normal. Take your time, run the code yourself, and try small variations. Learning R is a bit like learning to pipette: at first it feels awkward, but with practice it becomes second nature.
